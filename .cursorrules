# PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is an SEO agent designed to analyze and optimize websites for better search engine performance. The agent utilizes various tools to collect and analyze data, providing detailed reports on different aspects of the website's SEO. The primary tools used in this project include:

1. **BrowserlessScraper**: Scrapes website content and analyzes meta tags, SEO elements, content structure, keyword frequency, link mapping, and media inventory.
2. **SubpageAnalyzer**: Analyzes page crawl and indexing status, content quality, user engagement metrics, internal linking patterns, page authority, and JavaScript-rendered content.
3. **LoadingTimeTracker**: Performs page load timing analysis, resource loading sequences, performance bottlenecks, network request patterns, page size measurements, and performance ratings.
4. **MobileTesting**: Evaluates viewport configuration, mobile responsiveness, touch element spacing, font size accessibility, content scaling, mobile-friendly images, media query implementation, mobile performance metrics, and user experience factors.

The agent is configured using YAML files (`agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`) and is built and deployed using Docker. The project is managed using Git for version control and developed primarily in Python, leveraging the `crewai` library for AI agent development. The build system used is `hatchling`, and the preferred code editor is VSCode.

The goal of this project is to provide comprehensive SEO analysis and optimization recommendations to improve website performance and search engine rankings.



# PERSONALITY



# TECH STECK 


1. **Python**: The primary programming language used for developing the AI agents. We use Python version 3.10 to 3.13.
2. **crewai**: A specialized library for AI agent development. We are using version 0.79.4 or higher, but less than 1.0.0.
3. **hatchling**: A modern build system for Python projects, used for building and packaging our application.
4. **YAML**: Used for configuration files, such as `agents.yaml` and `tasks.yaml`, to define agent behaviors and tasks.
5. **Git**: Version control system to manage our codebase and collaborate with team members.
6. **Docker**: Containerization tool to ensure consistent environments across different stages of development and deployment.
7. **VSCode**: Preferred code editor for its rich extensions and support for Python development.
